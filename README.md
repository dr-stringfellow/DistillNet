# DistillNet
This is the code for training and validating DistillNet from the paper "Distilling particle knowledge for fast reconstruction at high-energy physics experiments" (https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2311.12551). It includes the training, physics validation functions (-> MET and Jet clustering) as well as the code utilized for profiling.
