# DistillNet
This is the code for training and testing DistillNet from the paper "Distilling particle knowledge for fast reconstruction at high-energy physics experiments" (https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2311.12551). It includes the training, physics validation functions (-> MET and Jet clustering) as well as the code utilized for profiling.
It can be run after downloading the repository and installing the requirements.txt by changing the filepaths in the config to the desired paths and then executing the train_distillnet script.
